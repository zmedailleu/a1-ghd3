Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

For this project, I created a stick figure using simple shapes and paths with the d3 library. He has a pink face with yellow eyes, blue arms and legs, and a brown hat. His head and eyes are circles, his body is a rectangle, his arms and legs are lines, and his hat and mouth were created with paths. His shirt is a gradient that mimics the colors of a calming sunset on a beach landscape.

When you click anywhere on the screen, the figure will wink at you and his arms and legs will shift position, assuming a dancing pose. Click again, and he'll return right back to normal like nothing ever happened.
